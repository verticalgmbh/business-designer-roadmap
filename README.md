# BusinessDesigner roadmap
In this repository, you can find the official vertical BusinessDesigner public product roadmap. Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback via the Share feedback page.

# Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with a label that indicates each of the following:

* A release phase that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.
* A feature area that indicates the area of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current product areas, see below.

# Release phases

Every product or feature goes through a set of release phases, from early testing to general availability.

* design: The feature is still in the functional and technical design process
* development: Primarily for testing and feedback. Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided
* beta: Beta staging is currently not available but will be provided in the near future
* production: Generally available to all customers. Ready for production use

# Roadmap stages

The roadmap is arranged on a project board to give a sense for how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the quarter in which it is expected to ship next. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. You'll also find an Exploratory column, which is used in conjunction with the in design and exploring release phase labels for when no timeframe is yet available.

# Feature Areas

The following is a list of our current product areas:

* customer: Features for all customers which are using the product
* product-management: Features which are targeting the product management for the marketplace. Customers mostly benefit indirectly from these improvments
* product-lifecycle: Features which improve or change the lifecycle management of services
